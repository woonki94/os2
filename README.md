# Operating Systems Course

This course provides an in-depth exploration of the internals of modern operating systems, focusing on the integration of hardware and software. Through hands-on labs, you will learn fundamental concepts of operating systems by building your own operating system from the ground up. 

## Course Overview

- **Goal**: Understand the internal workings of modern operating systems and gain practical experience by building an operating system.
- **Method**: Hands-on labs using JOS, an educational operating system project.

## Course Content

### 1. Booting (Lab 1)
- **Objective**: Learn the bootstrapping process of an operating system.
- **Activities**: 
  - Understand how an OS starts up.
  - Implement the initial bootloader for JOS.

### 2. Virtual Memory (Lab 2)
- **Objective**: Explore virtual memory concepts and mechanisms.
- **Activities**: 
  - Implement virtual memory management.
  - Work on address translation and memory isolation.

### 3. Process Management (Lab 3)
- **Objective**: Dive into process management and execution.
- **Activities**: 
  - Implement process creation, execution, and management.
  - Understand how the OS schedules and manages processes.

### 4. Multi-tasking (Lab 4)
- **Objective**: Learn about multi-tasking and concurrency in operating systems.
- **Activities**: 
  - Implement context switching and multitasking.
  - Manage multiple processes running simultaneously.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, you will:
- Understand the internal mechanisms of modern operating systems.
- Gain practical experience in OS development.
- Be able to implement key OS components such as bootloaders, virtual memory, process management, and multitasking.
- Understand and resolve concurrency and deadlock issues in systems.
