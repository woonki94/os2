# Lab 1: Getting Started with x86 Assembly, Booting, and Kernel Initialization

This lab is split into three parts, each designed to progressively introduce you to essential concepts and tools required to build and understand a simple operating system. The lab is part of the Operating System course and focuses on getting familiar with x86 assembly language, the QEMU x86 emulator, and the initial stages of kernel development.

## Lab Overview

### Part 1: x86 Assembly Language and QEMU Emulator
- **Objective**: Get familiarized with x86 assembly language, the QEMU x86 emulator, and the PCâ€™s power-on bootstrap procedure.
- **Activities**:
  - Learn basic x86 assembly instructions.
  - Explore the QEMU emulator, a key tool for running and testing x86 operating systems.
  - Understand the bootstrap process that a PC undergoes during power-on.

### Part 2: Boot Loader
- **Objective**: Examine the boot loader that initializes our kernel.
- **Activities**:
  - Investigate the boot loader code located in the `boot/` directory of the `jos/` tree.
  - Understand how the boot loader prepares the system and loads the kernel into memory.

### Part 3: Kernel Initialization
- **Objective**: Explore the initial template for our kernel, named JOS.
- **Activities**:
  - Analyze the initial kernel code in the `kernel/` directory.
  - Understand the fundamental setup of an operating system kernel.
